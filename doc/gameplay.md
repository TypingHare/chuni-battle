## Story

It was in my age of 14 when I firstly coded up my first program in Visual Basic. And in that time, a small web
game called Battle Without End(战斗无止境) prevailed among the boys in the class. We were
excitingly discussing what weapons, armors, and some other stuffs we got in the game every day after school. I, silent
as usual, heard them in great delight, and took courage to announce a decision, which is considered over-ambitious even
at present—I would make a better version of the game. My pals were shocked and laughed: "Fine, we will sure await."

Since we were into a hit anime called Love, Chunibyo & Other
Delusions (中二病でも恋がしたい！), I decided to come up with a name for this game by fusing the two elements
together–Chuni Battle (中二战斗无止境), where "Chuni", as the abbreviation of "Chunibyo", is a word that "typically used
to describe early teens who have grandiose delusions, who desperately want to stand out, and who have convinced
themselves that they have hidden knowledge or secret powers" defined by wiki.

I have tried to develop this game in many programming languages, like VB, Java, and JavaScript, but failed. I think the
main problem to the failures stem from two reasons: first, I lack knowledge and experience about game development; and
second, I am always in a 3-minute passion. Recently, I am eating several useful game development books to enhance my
necessary capability; and honestly, I don't think anybody still remember my spur-of-the-moment promise, thus time is
affluent given that my body is quite sound at present. I view failures as worst case scenario for the next attempts.
That ensure me to make progress over time. Indeed, in my fourth attempt, which is this project, I finally made a decent
game data management engine by drawing on the Minecraft decompiled code and leveraging the power TypeScript. I know how
many obstacles and hurdles lie ahead, but I still wish I can make a first draft this time.

Days and nights are like a launched arrow("Time flies" in Chinese expression), and the good old days and my feeling of
nostalgia is wrapped in the unadorned and childish dream.

## The Endless Battle

This game took inspiration from Battle Without End, an obscure AFK (Away From Keyboard) game made with flash. The author
of the game
published it as a web game and hasn't released a new version for a couple of years. The game is very easy. First,
players pick an ethic, and the hero will then begin to fight with random mobs. Note that the game has a very simple
interface, which has nothing but a bunch of data. Therefore, players can do nothing but stare at the data on the screen.
The hero levels up, grows, and harvests items over time. The player can equip hero with weapons and armors, and let it
learn abilities. Also, weapons and armors can be forged, which may either level them up or spoil it. There is also a pet
system. After beating a random generated boss, players may get a pet that can assist the hero.

In short, this game is a classic RPG game without graphic content. Players are unable to enjoy the stimulation from the
screen as other video games have. However, it frees players from dull operations, and brings about a series of surprise
when they wake up the next day.

Even though this game attracts many people like my pals in those years, it provides little elements, and is missing
background and plots. After all, this game is more likely to be a college assignment which the author is used to get
over his or her course.

## Chuni Battle

I want to do a remake of Battle Without End, but add some more elements, including a background, stories, and new
systems to the game.
